In Python, as in most programming languages, we have the ability to get very granualar in how we interact with the computer, but we can also stand on the shoulders of giants and reuse their work.  This is what we will opt to do as often as possible, other people have figured out the gory details of how to interpret the format of an Excel file so we don't have to - I'd rather depend on their work and focus on the real value add for our projects - that is spending time doing something with the data!</p>\n",

The code is stored in a \"module\" called pandas (keep in mind that case matters, so Pandas is not the same as pandas).  For simplicity we are going to ask Python to make the utilities in this module available to us whenever we specify the shortcut 'pd'.  (The pd shortcut is common for Pandas).
